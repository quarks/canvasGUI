Model Description	: Gah. My nightmare. A project I started a long time ago and enlisted the help of some very
			  talented skinners to help me out. Things were going good, and I had high hopes for this
			  model, then I got distracted by some crap, like moving, left him to rot on my HD for ages.
			  Every time I came back to tweak him and finish it off, something fucked up. I can no
			  Longer edit the files cause of software version differences, the files are all over my HD,
			  and I can't even see him in Q2 since it doesn't like my new video card and won't load. The
			  last time I even saw this model was months ago. But I showed it to Firestarter cause I 
			  felt like a flake, and he encouraged my to send it out anyways, and have faith that people
			  would look past his short comings. And even though the model has problems, you can still 
			  check out the great skins, cause I owe the skinners that much at least. Read further to
			  see his problems.

Thanks go out to        : FIRESTARTER! OgrO_FIX! BURNT KONA! CRASH!
			  I gave them a nightmare of a skin map, and they all said "Ya! Painting on this segmented piece of
			  crap may be like having a rusty hook gouge my eyes out over a long period of time, but
			  hey! We love you Science! I'll do anything to skin your great model!" ok... they might
			  not have said that EXACTLY, but that's how I remember it, and I now that's how they were
			  feeling.
			  My sincerest apologies guys. You did great work.

(please don't kill me)

Editors Used		:this model is crap! forget it! it doesn't count! Why do you care?

Other Rants:
	on my failings:

		1. First! this started as a decent model! so construction and poly count are alright... still break
		   800, but better than @'s count.

		2. Second! the big problems! If i remember right... uh... don't even bother looking at the wave 
		   animation or you may go blind! really! and the sad part is, I was just messing with a new anim.
		   I had a fairly good flying spin kick in there before, and now I can't even change it back! It
		   could be a half decent model if not for that! dammit! and man... the crouch walk... *sigh* I was
		   doing some experimentation there too... I think the CRdeath is about 2 keyframes as well,,, 1 
		   crouching at the first frame, then 1 dead at the last frame... *double sigh* The stand anim too..
		   it loops fairly poorly. I was editing that too, but thankfully I was almost done... I think the 
		   only other problems are the pain anims 1 and 3... more experimentation, but pain 2 should be ok.

		3. this isn't really a problem since I took them out but... I even had like, 7 Vweps done, but they
		   would be floating all over the model trying to match animations that don't exist, So I got rid of
		   them. Man do I ever suck.		 

any questions, concerns, flames, send them my way... I don't know if the skinners want to be bothered, of if I 
should put their addresses in here or not so.... if u have anything to say to them, just send it though me and
I'll pass it along

I REALLY hope these are the right files...
